# Predicting Premature Mortality from Electronic Health Records (EHR) and Claims Data 
Machine Learning models used are logistic regression, random forest, decision tree, K-nearest neighbors with hyperparameter tuning. Models were evaluated using confusion matrix (recall and f-1 score).

Guidelines for usage:
The code files must be executed in the following sequential order: wrangling, merging, EDA, and ML models.
The datasets and findings folder contains the initial data files as well as the findings obtained from the models.
